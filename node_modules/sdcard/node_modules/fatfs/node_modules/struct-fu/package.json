Note that for standalone fields the `name` and `count` parameters are always optional. For fields nested within a struct field, you must provide a `name`.\n\n- `_.struct(name, fields, count)` — `fields` is an array of nested fields, which will be packed directly one after another with no concern for any particular compiler's alignment preferences. The first field in the array will start at the first byte in the buffer. (For bitfields you may wish to provide a `fields.reverse()` value to match little endian compilers.) Anonymous (i.e. un-named) structs will read/write fields directly within their parent struct; this is useful for reusing common fields or inlining bitfields.\n- `_.char(name, size, count)` — UTF-8 string. Writes NUL-terminated only if too short, not if string fits exact size or gets truncated. Reads to NUL or full size, whichever comes first. Note that node.js will not write incomplete characters from the BMP (i.e. Unicode code points that can be represented by a single `.charCodeAt()`), but does seem to split some UTF-8ish semblance of surrogate pairs.\n- `_.char16le(name, size, count)` — UTF-16BLE string. This has the same behavior as `_.char`; note that `size` is still the *width* of the field (in bytes) and *not* the number of UTF-16 surrogate pairs. Node.js may truncate between surrogate pairs rather than Unicode code points, but if given an odd-sized width will terminate with `\\0` rather than half of a `.charCodeAt()` value.\n- `_.byte(name, size, count)` — Binary buffer. Writes truncated or zero padded as necessary. Always reads field to full size.\n- `_.<numeric type>(name, count)` — Floats and integers, defaulting to network byte order (i.e. Big Endian) or you can use the `…le` versions. Numeric type fields pretty much correspond directly to the equivalent node.js `Buffer` read/write methods you would expect. (There are no 64-bit integers because JavaScript does not properly support the full range of such values.)\n    - `_.float32`\n    - `_.float64`\n    - `_.uint8`\n    - `_.uint16`\n    - `_.uint32`\n    - `_.int8`\n    - `_.int16`\n    - `_.int32`\n    - `_.float32le`\n    - `_.float64le`\n    - `_.uint16le`\n    - `_.uint32le`\n    - `_.int16le`\n    - `_.int32le`\n\nAll the field above implement the same interface once created:\n\n- `field.name` — The name of this field instance or `null` if none was provided.\n- `field.size` — The total size of buffer this field (including any nested/repeated fields) will read/write.\n- `field.pack(val, buf)` (alias: `bytesFromValue`) — The type of `val` provided will depend on the field (e.g. number for numerics, object for structs, array for any counted field), but this method always returns a buffer. `buf` is optional — if you do not provide a slice of an existing buffer to fill, a new buffer of length `field.size` will be returned.\n- `field.unpack(buf)` (alias: `valueFromBytes`) — Returns a JavaScript value extracted from the provided buffer.\n\nYou can use each of these fields nested inside a structure, or on their own. For example, `_.uint32(2).unpack(Buffer(8))` uses an anonymous field to convert the unitialized buffer into an array of two somewhat-random numbers.\n\n### Extended field interfaces\n\nThe basic field (and bitfield) interface gets extended in several cases:\n\n- `arrayField.field` — if a field was created with a `count`, this property holds a reference to the \"original\" field.\n- `structField.fields` — for a field of type `_.struct`, this property is an object giving you access to nested fields by name\n- `nestedField.offset` — a field fetched via `structField.fields` will have an offset property. For normal fields this is a number given in bytes; for bitfield types (see below) this will be an object with separate `bytes` and `bits` properties. (Note that you can reuse a field within multiple structures and it will have the correct offset within each. The `nestedField` found in each `structField.fields` is actually a **new** object whose *prototype* is the original (reused) field.)\n\nTaken together, these special properties allow you to do things like:\n\n```js\nvar _ = require('struct-fu');\nvar itemList = _.struct([\n    _.char(\"name\", 24),\n    _.struct(\"ownerName\", [\n        _.char(\"first\", 12),\n        _.char(\"last\", 42)\n    ]),\n    _.struct(\"flags\", [\n        _.bool(\"isBorrowed\"),\n        _.bool(\"needsRepair\"),\n        _.ubit('_reserved', 6)\n    ]),\n    _.uint16(\"howMany\")\n], 16);\n\nvar itemType = itemList.field,\n    countField = itemType.fields['howMany'],\n    ownerField = itemType.fields['ownerName'];\nconsole.log(\"Each item has fields:\", Object.keys(itemType.fields).join(', '));\nconsole.log(\"Within an item, count is at offset:\", countField.offset);\nconsole.log(\"Here is an owner name converted on its own:\", ownerField.pack({first:\"Foorenious\", last:\"Barçuno\"}));\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n> Each item has fields: name, ownerName, flags, howMany\n>\n> Within an item, count is at offset: 79\n>\n> Here is an owner name converted on its own: \\<Buffer 46 6f 6f 72 65 6e 69 6f 75 73 00 00 42 61 72 c3 a7 75 6e 6f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...>\n\n\n### Bitfield types\n\nThese fields are intended for use *only* within a parent `_.struct` field (and therefore `name` is not optional):\n\n- `_.bool(name, count)` — A single bit, read back as a boolean.\n- `_.ubit(name, width, count)` — An unsigned integer; most significant bit first.\n- `_.ubitLE(name, width, count)` — An unsigned integer; least significant bit first.\n- `_.sbit(name, width, count)` — A signed integer; if the most sigificant bit is set the value is negative.\n\nExcept for the `bitfield.name` and `bitfield.width` properties, the bitfield interface (used internally by `_.struct`) is undocumented and subject to change.\n\n\n### Special field types\n\nThese do not obey any of the rules above. Right now there is only one such field:\n\n- `_.padTo(offset)` — An anoymous field that must be contained within a `_.struct` to be of any use. The presence of a `_.padTo` field increases the size of the containing `_.struct` (and adjusts the offset of any following field) to the `offset` provided. This field is safe (and potentially convenient!) to use after bitfield types. Padding is also special in that it causes the containing struct's `.pack` to *leave alone* any current buffer contents under the padded region, rather than initializing to default values as a bytefield would do. Padding ensures the struct, or rather, the struct up to and including this field, is neither less (nor more!) than the intended size.\n\n\n## License\n\n© 2014 Nathan Vander Wilt.\nFunding for this work was provided in part by Technical Machine, Inc.\n\nReuse under your choice of:\n\n* [BSD-2-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n* [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\n",
